The overview of the "Question Answer PDF BOT Project" involves creating a web application that allows users to ask questions and receive answers related to the content of the book. Here are the key components of this project:

Text Extraction from PDF: The project starts with extracting text from whatever PDF is uplaoded. This text serves as the knowledge base for answering user queries.

Web Application Development: A Flask web application is developed. This app provides a user interface where users can submit their questions.

Question Processing: When a user submits a question through the web app, the question is sent to the backend.
 
API Integration: The Flask app integrates with a Model or a similar service. This integration is used to process the user's question against the extracted text from the book.

Answer Generation: The model processes the question and generates an answer based on the content of "The 48 Laws of Power." The answer is then sent back to the web app.

Displaying Answers: The web app displays the generated answer to the user, completing the question-answer cycle.

Testing and Validation: The app is thoroughly tested, including testing in an incognito mode to simulate a fresh user experience.

Documentation and Demonstration: A video demonstration (e.g., using Loom) is created to showcase how the app works. This includes recording the process of asking questions and receiving answers.


Deployment: The web application is hosted online, making it accessible to users for interaction.
